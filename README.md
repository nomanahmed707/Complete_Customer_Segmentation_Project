* **Dataset**: Shopping Trends data (`shopping_trends.csv`)
* **Techniques Used**:

  * 📊 EDA with Seaborn, Plotly & Matplotlib
  * 🧹 Data Cleaning & Encoding
  * 🧠 PCA for Dimensionality Reduction
  * 🧩 Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
  * 🎯 Classification with Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest
  * ✅ Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix & Classification Report

## 🎯 Goals

* Identify key customer groups using clustering techniques
* Visualize high-dimensional data effectively
* Build predictive models to classify shopping behavior
* Provide business insights based on data patterns
